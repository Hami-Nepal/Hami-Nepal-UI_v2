            record of producing tangible and effective assistance during the
            public crisis in Nepal through volunteer work and donations; our
            efforts and assistance were widely lauded during the crisis arising
            in the aftermath of the earthquake in 2015. On 25 April, 2015 an
            earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 Richter scale struck Nepal along
            with continued aftershocks occurring throughout the nation at the
            intervals of 15â€“20 minutes. The earthquake affected a huge
            population of the nation with about 9,000 fatalities and nearly
            22,000 injured people.
