    quote: `On 25 April, 2015 an earthquake with a magnitudeof 7.8 Richter scale
      struck Nepal along with continued aftershocks occurring throughout 
      the nation at the intervals of 15–20 minutes. The earthquake affected
       a huge population of the nation with about 9,000 
      fatalities and nearly 22,000 injured people.All of the hospitals in 
      Kathmandu were in chaos and unmanaged with injured people 
      flowing in rapidly. The National Trauma Center, a government 
      hospital, was no exception. After hearing the Information, several 
      youths went to the trauma hospital and offered to volunteer in order to
       control the situation. Our organization founder, Mr. Sudan Gurung,
       was also one of them.The volunteering youths started calling 
      themselves “I to We” at that time because of discrete reasons. 
      However, the name was later changed into ‘HamiNepal’, which is 
      roughly translated as ‘We for Nepal’. It is how people with helping 
      intention came along and formed the HamiNepal Youth

    quote: `Dr. Rupak B. K. Ghimire is our young and enthusiastic dermatologist and hair transplant surgeon. He is popularly known as Ayushman Ghimire as he has been a winner of Mr Nepal 2011, lead actor in a movie and appeared in many tv commercials and advertisements.

    He completed his MBBS, MD from Kathmandu University and training in basic hair transplant surgery from Satyam Hair Transplants, India and International Fellowship in Hair Transplant Surgery from Dana Plastic Surgery Clinic, South Korea. He was also an Assistant Professor at Kathmandu Medical College, Sinamangal.
    
    He is a vice president at Hami Nepal. He believes we can make a change at different stages- social service, social movement & politics. Social service is solely a one way process where we just contribute without any demands or expectations. Social movements are forms where we demand for changes in policy, implementation as well as in events of social injustice & issues. He thinks political movements can drive above aspects in larger aspects and youths should be aware of political changes as well as to enter the system and make a change.

    Pragya believes in creating a platform that acts as a catalyst for more inclusive, networked and effective forms to transform the current scenario into a better nation and future for all. She says that this depends on everyone, everywhere, and can only be done successfully if we are unswerving and hell bent on combining our efforts towards our common agenda for the benefit of humanity. It is our choice to make this a reality before it is too late.

    quote: `My name is Yogendra Shrestha, and I've been volunteering at Hami Nepal as the treasurer. I've also been a member of a couple of social groups, including the Jagaruk Maru Yuba Club and the Maruhiti toll sudhar samiti. The major reason I volunteered at Hami Nepal is because I am passionate about working in the field of social work. I enjoy serving the people of my country and hope to set an example for others.
    This platform conveys a more ambitious message. It explains how the individuals participating in an organization make a difference, gives them a feeling of purpose, and elicits their support. What followed afterwards will even be more significant: aiding in the relief of people's suffering, fighting for social justice, and improving people's lives and communities. I may be a voice for those who are not heard, and can address significant social issues in order to craft solutions that can help individuals realize their greatest motivation to make our nation a better place to live.`,
